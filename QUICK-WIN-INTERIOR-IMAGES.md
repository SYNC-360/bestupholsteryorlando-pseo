## 🎯 **What to Look For (2-minute selection guide)**

### **PERFECT Interior Design Photos:**
- ✅ **Upholstered furniture as the hero** (sofas, chairs, ottomans)
- ✅ **Bright, natural lighting** showing fabric quality
- ✅ **Professional photography** (crisp, well-composed)
- ✅ **Contemporary/transitional style** (broad appeal)  
- ✅ **Neutral to warm colors** (timeless, not trendy)
- ✅ **Clean, uncluttered rooms** (focus on fabric/furniture)

### **AVOID:**
- ❌ Ultra-modern/minimalist (too cold)
- ❌ Dark/moody lighting (hides fabric details)
- ❌ Cluttered/busy compositions 
- ❌ Obvious budget furniture
- ❌ Overly staged/fake looking
