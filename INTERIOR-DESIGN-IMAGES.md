## 🎨 **Visual Style Guidelines for Selection**

### **✅ PERFECT for Our Brand**
- **Professional photography** (not phone pics)
- **Clean, uncluttered** compositions
- **Natural lighting** (avoids harsh studio look)  
- **Neutral to warm color palettes** 
- **Contemporary/transitional style** (broad appeal)
- **Focus on upholstered furniture** as hero elements
- **Lifestyle aspirational** but achievable

### **❌ AVOID These Styles**
- **Ultra-modern/minimalist** (too cold for upholstery focus)
- **Overly formal/traditional** (limits appeal)
- **Dated styling** (anything that screams specific decade)
- **Cluttered/busy** compositions
- **Dark/moody lighting** (doesn't show fabric quality)
- **Obvious staging** (fake flowers, perfectly placed books)
- **Budget furniture** (undermines authority)

## 💡 **Pro Tips for Interior Design Image Selection**

For every image, ask:

2. **Can you imagine discussing fabric choices for these pieces?**
3. **Does it reinforce our climate/performance messaging?**
4. **Would this room make someone want better upholstery?**

### **The "Authority" Test** 
For every image, ask:
1. **Does this look like work we could have done?**
2. **Does it demonstrate sophisticated fabric understanding?**
3. **Would an interior designer be proud of this room?**
4. **Does it justify professional upholstery investment?**

### **The "Regional Relevance" Test**
For every image, ask:
1. **Could this room exist in Florida/the Southeast?**
2. **Does the lighting/style match regional preferences?** 
3. **Are the fabric choices climate-appropriate?**
4. **Would locals find this inspiring vs. foreign?**
